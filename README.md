# Description
For ease of use, i changed the version variables inside the makefile of nixbox (toooling folder) to match latest stable version 24.11 (hopefuly stable)
# Usage:
Use:

```make```
Will be building the box inside the /BUILD_DIR folder which would not be needed after building the .box file, that is all we need it for, IoT pdf says "The evaluation process will happen on the computer of the evaluated
group." so will simply just build the .box before starting corrections, then we would only need dimple vagrant up --> vagrant ssh.


```vagrant up```
Just gets everything up and running, you are now ready to vagrant ssh into either of the nodes
```vagrant ssh atouatiS or atouatiSW`
